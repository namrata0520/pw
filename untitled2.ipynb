        "1. What are data structures, and why are they important?\n",
        "Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and modified\n",
        "efficiently. They are essential because they provide different methods to organize and manage data for\n",
        "various applications, optimizing for tasks like retrieval, insertion, deletion, and modification. Common\n",
        "types include lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Choosing the right data structure is important for\n",
        "the performance of an algorithm and the scalability of a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples\n",
        "Mutable data types can be modified after they are created. Examples include:\n",
        "Lists: You can change elements, append, or remove items.\n",
        "Dictionaries: You can add, remove, or modify key-value pairs.\n",
        "Immutable data types cannot be changed once they are created. Examples include:\n",
        "Strings: Once a string is defined, you cannot modify it.\n",
        "Tuples: Once elements are assigned to a tuple, it cannot be modified (no add/remove operations).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n",
        "Lists are mutable: You can modify a list by adding, removing, or changing its elements.\n",
        "Tuples are immutable: Once created, the elements of a tuple cannot be modified.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "python\n",
        "\n",
        "# List\n",
        "lst = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "lst[0] = 10  # You can change an element in a list\n",
        "# Tuple\n",
        "tup = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "# tup[0] = 10  # This would raise an error as tuples are immutable\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Describe how dictionaries store data\n",
        "Dictionaries in Python store data as key-value pairs. Each key is unique and maps to a corresponding\n",
        "value. Internally, Python dictionaries use a hash table for quick lookups, which means that the key is\n",
        "hashed, and the value is retrieved using that hash.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "python\n",
        "\n",
        "my_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25}\n",
        "print(my_dict[\"name\"])  # Output: Alice\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "You might use a set instead of a list when:\n",
        "You want to eliminate duplicate values.\n",
        "You require faster membership tests (in keyword) since sets are optimized for this.\n",
        "You don’t care about the order of elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
        "A string in Python is a sequence of characters. It is different from a list because:\n",
        "Strings are immutable, meaning you cannot modify individual characters.\n",
        "Lists are mutable, so their elements can be changed, added, or removed.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "python\n",
        "\n",
        "my_str = \"Hello\"\n",
        "# my_str[0] = ’h’  # This would raise an error because strings are immutable\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "my_list[0] = 10  # This is allowed because lists are mutable\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "Tuples ensure data integrity because they are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after\n",
        "creation. This guarantees that the data inside a tuple remains constant and unaltered throughout the\n",
        "program, which can be useful in situations where constant values are necessary, such as storing\n",
        "coordinates or function arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "A hash table is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to specific positions (or \"buckets\")\n",
        "in an array, allowing for fast retrieval of values. Dictionaries in Python are implemented using hash tables,\n",
        " where the keys are hashed to quickly find their corresponding values.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
        "Yes, lists can contain different data types. A list in Python is a heterogeneous collection, so it can store\n",
        "integers, strings, other lists, and even custom objects.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "python\n",
        "\n",
        "my_list = [1, \"apple\", 3.14, [2, 3]]\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python\n",
        "Strings are immutable in Python for efficiency reasons. When strings are created, Python stores them in a\n",
        " memory-efficient way (interning), and making them immutable ensures that they can be shared safely\n",
        "between different parts of a program. This immutability also helps prevent accidental changes to string\n",
        "data.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "Dictionaries provide several advantages over lists, including:\n",
        "Faster lookups: Searching for a value by key in a dictionary is faster than searching by index in a list,\n",
        "especially with large datasets.\n",
        "Key-value pairs: You can store data in pairs, associating specific keys with values.\n",
        "No need for ordering: You don’t have to worry about ordering the elements as you do in a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list\n",
        "A tuple is preferable over a list when:\n",
        "You need to store unchangeable data, like fixed coordinates or a record of values that should not be\n",
        "altered.\n",
        "You want to use it as a key in a dictionary, since tuples are hashable (unlike lists). Example:\n",
        "python\n",
        "\n",
        "# Tuple for coordinates\n",
        "coordinates = (10, 20)\n",
        "# Tuple as dictionary key\n",
        "location = {(10, 20): \"Home\"}\n",
        "\n",
        "13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "Sets automatically eliminate duplicates. If you try to add a duplicate value to a set, it will not be included.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "python\n",
        "\n",
        "my_set = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}\n",
        "print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4} (duplicates are removed)\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How does the \"in\" keyword work differently for lists and sets?\n",
        "For lists, the \"in\" keyword checks if an element exists by iterating over the list (which can be slow for large\n",
        " lists).\n",
        "For sets, the \"in\" keyword is faster because sets are implemented using hash tables, making membership\n",
        " tests almost constant time.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "python\n",
        "\n",
        "# List membership test (slower)\n",
        "lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "print(3 in lst)  # Output: True\n",
        "# Set membership test (faster)\n",
        "my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n",
        "print(3 in my_set)  # Output: True\n",
        "\n",
        "### 15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.\n",
        "No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple because tuples are **immutable** in Python. Once a tuple\n",
        "is created, its elements cannot be altered, added, or removed. This immutability is what makes tuples\n",
        "useful for representing constant data and ensures data integrity.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "‘‘‘python\n",
        "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "# my_tuple[0] = 10  # This would raise a TypeError because tuples are immutable\n",
        "‘‘‘\n",
        "\n",
        "### 16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case.\n",
        "A **nested dictionary** is a dictionary where some of its values are also dictionaries. It allows you to\n",
        "represent more complex data structures, like hierarchical or multi-level information.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "‘‘‘python\n",
        "nested_dict = {\n",
        "\"person1\": {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30},\n",
        "\"person2\": {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25}\n",
        "}\n",
        "# Accessing nested data\n",
        "print(nested_dict[\"person1\"][\"name\"])  # Output: Alice\n",
        "‘‘‘\n",
        "Use case:  - A nested dictionary can be useful for representing data like a contact list, where each person’s contact\n",
        "details (address, phone number, etc.) are stored as dictionaries within the main dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\n",
        "The time complexity of accessing elements in a **dictionary** is **O(1)** on average. This means that\n",
        "looking up a value using a key is generally constant time, regardless of the size of the dictionary. This is\n",
        "because dictionaries use hash tables internally, which allow for quick access based on the hashed key.\n",
        "However, in the worst case (due to hash collisions), the time complexity can degrade to O(n), but this is\n",
        "rare.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        "**Lists** are preferred over **dictionaries** when:  - You need to maintain the **order** of elements (since lists are ordered).  - You need to store a **sequence of items** where access is done by index, or you need to iterate over\n",
        "the elements.  - You have **duplicates** in the data (since lists can store multiple occurrences of the same element).\n",
        "Example:  - If you’re storing a sequence of numbers or a collection of items that don’t need key-value pairs, a list is a\n",
        " better choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
        "Dictionaries are considered **unordered** because they do not maintain the order of insertion of keys and\n",
        " values. This means that when you iterate over a dictionary, the order in which the elements are returned\n",
        "may not be the same as the order in which they were added.\n",
        "However, in Python 3.7 and above, dictionaries preserve the insertion order as an implementation detail,\n",
        "which means the order of keys is maintained when iterating, but you should not rely on this behavior if\n",
        "order is important for your logic.\n",
        "Because dictionaries are unordered, **data retrieval is done using the key**, and not based on the order\n",
        "of elements. This makes accessing data faster but without any guarantee of order.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.  - **List**: Data is retrieved based on the **index**. Each element has a specific position (index) in the list,\n",
        "and you can access elements by specifying the index.  - Time complexity for access: **O(1)** (constant time, if you know the index).\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "‘‘‘python\n",
        "my_list = [10, 20, 30]\n",
        "print(my_list[1])  # Output: 20\n",
        "‘‘‘  - **Dictionary**: Data is retrieved based on the **key**. A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs,\n",
        "where you use a unique key to access the corresponding value.  - Time complexity for access: **O(1)** (on average), as dictionaries use hash tables for fast key lookup.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "‘‘‘python\n",
        "my_dict = {\"a\": 10, \"b\": 20}\n",
        "print(my_dict[\"b\"])  # Output: 20\n",
        "‘‘‘\n",
        "**Key difference**:\n",
        "- In a list, elements are accessed by their index, while in a dictionary, elements are accessed by their key.- Lists are ordered (so you can rely on the position of elements), but dictionaries are unordered (access is\n",
        " based on keys, not order).\n",
